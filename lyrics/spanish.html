<H3><A NAME="Spanish"></A>Spanish Train</H3>

There's a Spanish train that runs between
<BR>Gualdalquivir and old Saville,
<BR>And at dead of night the whistle blows,
<BR>And people hear she's running still...

<P>And then they hush their children back to sleep,
<BR>Lock the doors, upstairs they creep,
<BR>For it is said that the souls of the dead
<BR>Fill that train ten thousand deep!!

<P>Well a railway man lay dying with his people by his side,
<BR>His family were crying, knelt in prayer before he died,
<BR>But above his bed just a-waiting for the dead,
<BR>Was the Devil with a twinkle in his eye,
<BR>"Well God's not around and look what I've found,
<BR>this one's mine!!"

<P>Just then the Lord himself appeared in a blinding flash of light,
<BR>And shouted at the Devil, "Get thee hence to endless night!!"
<BR>But the Devil just grinned and said "I may have sinned,
<BR>But there's no need to push me around,
<BR>I got him first so you can do your worst,
<BR>he's going underground!!"

<P>"But I think I'll give you one more chance"
<BR>said the Devil with a smile,
<BR>"So throw away that stupid lance,
<BR>it's really not your style",
<BR>"Joker is the name,
<BR>Poker is the game,
<BR>we'll play right here on this bed,
<BR>And then we'll bet for the biggest stakes yet,
<BR>the souls of the dead!!"

<P>And I said "Look out, Lord, He's going to win,
<BR>The sun is down and the night is riding in,
<BR>That train is dead on time, many souls are on the line,
<BR>Oh Lord, He's going to win!.."

<P>Well the railway man he cut the cards
<BR>and he dealt them each a hand of five
<BR>And for the Lord he was praying hard
<BR>or that train he'd have to drive...
<BR>Well the Devil he had three aces and a king,
<BR>and the Lord, he was running for a straight,
<BR>he had the queen and the knave and nine and ten of spades,
<BR>All he needed was the eight...

<P>And then the Lord he called for one more card,
<BR>but he drew the diamond eight,
<BR>And the Devil said to the son of God,
<BR>"I believe you've got it straight,
<BR>So deal me one for the time has come
<BR>to see who'll be the king of this place,
<BR>But as he spoke, from beneath his cloak,
<BR>he slipped another ace...

<P>Ten thousand souls was the opening bid,
<BR>and it soon went up to fifty-nine,
<BR>But the Lord didn't see what the Devil did,
<BR>and he said "that suits me fine",
<BR>"I'll raise you high to a hundred and five,
<BR>and forever put an end to your sins",
<BR>But the Devil let out a mighty shout, "My hand wins!!"

<P>And I said "Lord, oh Lord, you let him win,
<BR>The sun is down and the night is riding in,
<BR>That train is dead on time, many souls are on the line,
<BR>Oh Lord, don't let him win..."

<P>Well that Spanish train still runs between,
<BR>Gualdalquivir and old Saville,
<BR>And at the dead of night the whistle blows,
<BR>And people fear she's running still...
<BR>And far away in some recess
<BR>The Lord and the Devil are now playing chess,
<BR>The Devil still cheats and wins more souls,
<BR>And as for the Lord, well, he's just doing his best...

<P>And I said "Lord, oh Lord, you've got to win,
<BR>The sun is down and the night is riding in,
<BR>That train is still on time, Oh my soul is on the line,
<BR>Oh Lord, you've got to win..."

<H3><A NAME="Lonely"></A>Lonely Sky</H3>

The cold north wind they call"La Bise"
<BR>is swirling round about my knees,
<BR>Trees are crying leaves into the river;

<P>I'm huddled in this french cafe
<BR>I never thought I'd see the day,
<BR>but winter's here and summer's really over,

<P><DD>Even the birds have packed up and gone,
<DD>They're flying south with their song,
<DD>And my love, she too has gone, she had to fly,

<P>Take care it's such a lonely sky,
<BR>They'll trap your wings my love and hold your flight,
<BR>They'll build a cage and steal your only sky,
<BR>Fly away, fly to me, fly when the wind is high,
<BR>I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky...

<P>The old cathedral lights are low
<BR>She and I we'd often go there
<BR>To admire and sometimes kneel in prayer;

<P>Lords and Ladies lie in stone,
<BR>Hand in hand from long ago,
<BR>And though their hands are cold they'll love forever,

<P><DD>Even the choir rehearses those songs
<DD>For Christmas is not long,
<DD>And alone, I sing my song, she had to fly,

<P>Out there, it's such a lonely sky,
<BR>They'll trap your wings my love and hold your flight,
<BR>They'll build a cage and steal your only sky,
<BR>Fly away, fly to me, fly when the wind is high,
<BR>I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky,
<BR>Fly away fly to me, and if you need my love,
<BR>I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky...
<BR>I'll come in with the dawn,
<BR>I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky,
<BR>On the wings of the morn,
<BR>I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky,
<BR>Above the world we'll be flying,
<BR>I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky...

<H3><A NAME="Patricia"></A>Patricia The Stripper</H3>

Dennis is a menace with his "anyone for tennis?"
<BR>And beseeching me to come and keep the score...
<BR>And Maud says "Oh Lord! I'm so terribly bored!"
<BR>And I really can't stand it anymore...

<P>I'm going out to dinner with a gorgeous singer
<BR>To a little place I've found down by the Quay;
<BR>Her name is Patricia, she calls herself Delicia,
<BR>And the reason isn't very hard to see...

<P>She says God made her a sinner just to keep fat men thinner,
<BR>As they tumble down in heaps before her feet,
<BR>They hang around in groups like battle-weary troops,
<BR>One can often see them queue right down the street...

<P>You see Patricia, or Delicia, not only is a singer
<BR>She also removes all her clothing...
<BR>For Patricia is the best stripper in town,

<P><DD>And with a swing of her hips she started to strip,
<DD>To tremendous applause she took off her drawers,
<DD>And with a lick of her lips she undid all the clips
<DD>Threw it all in the air, and everybody stared,
<DD>And as the last piece of clothing fell to the floor,
<DD>The police were banging on the door,
<DD>On a Saturday night in nineteen twenty-four...

<P>Take it away boys

<P>But poor Patricia was arrested and everyone detested
<BR>The manner in which she was exposed,
<BR>And later on in court, well, everybody thought
<BR>That a summer run in Gaol would be proposed,

<P>But the Judge said, "Patricia,
<BR>Or may I say, Delicia,
<BR>The facts of this case lie before me...
<BR>Case dismissed...this girl was in her working clothes!!"

<P><DD>And with a swing of her hips she started to strip,
<DD>To tremendous applause she took off her drawers,
<DD>And with a lick of her lips she undid all the clips
<DD>Threw it all in the air, and everybody stared,
<DD>And as the last piece of clothing fell to the floor,
<DD>The police were yelling out for more!!!
<DD>On a Saturday night in nineteen twenty-four...
<DD>On a Saturday night in nineteen twenty-four...

<H3><A NAME="A"></A>A Spaceman Came Travelling</H3>

A spaceman came travelling on his ship from afar,
<BR>'Twas light years of time since his mission did start,
<BR>And over a village he halted his craft,
<BR>And it hung in the sky like a star, just like a star...

<P>He followed a light and came down to a shed,
<BR>Where a mother and child were lying there on a bed,
<BR>A bright light of silver shone round his head,
<BR>And he had the face of an angel, and they were afraid...

<P>Then the stranger spoke, he said "Do not fear,
<BR>I come from a planet a long way from here,
<BR>And I bring a message for mankind to hear",
<BR>And suddenly the sweetest music filled the air...

<P>And it went La La...
<BR>Peace and goodwill to all men, and love for the child...

<P>This lovely music went trembling through the ground,
<BR>And many were wakened on hearing that sound,
<BR>And travellers on the road, the village they found,
<BR>By the light of that ship in the sky, which shone all around...

<P>And just before dawn at the paling of the sky,
<BR>The stranger returned and said "Now I must fly,
<BR>When two thousand years of your time has gone by,
<BR>This song will begin once again, to a baby's cry..."

<P>And it went La La...This song will begin once again to a baby's cry...
<BR>And it goes La La...Peace and goodwill to all men, and love for the child...
<BR>Oh the whole world is waiting, waiting to hear the song again,
<BR>There are thousands standing on the edge of the world,
<BR>And a star is moving somewhere and the time is nearly here,
<BR>This song will begin once again, to a baby's cry...

<H3><A NAME="sailor"></A>Sailor</H3>

<P>Underneath a silver moon, the ship is like a ghost,
<BR>She's been out there for a week, just waiting for the wind to blow,
<BR>But now she's off and running, and there's nothing I can do,
<BR>'Cos I am just a prisoner here until this war is through,
<BR>And I'm singing,

<P>Sailor, can you hear me,
<BR>Sailor, hear my call,
<BR>Sailor, take me with you,
<BR>Sailor, take me home...

<P>Yesterday I saw a sea bird wheeling light and low,
<BR>Then she sailed off to the west
<BR>Like she was telling me the way to go,
<BR>If I had her wings my love I'd be with you tonight,
<BR>But my last hope has gone, it's drifting out of sight,
<BR>Wait for me,

<P>Oh Sailor, take me to her,
<BR>Sailor, take me home...

<P>To feel the wind, to see the sky,
<BR>To hear the waves breaking on the shore again,
<BR>To be with you, to lie with you,
<BR>To hear your voice echo through the hills again,
<BR>Oh my darling wait for me, 'cos I will be there,
<BR>When it is over, when it is over,
<BR>Yes I will return one day,

<P>Sailor, take me to her,
<BR>Oh Sailor, take me home,
<BR>Sailor, can you hear me,
<BR>Sailor, hear my call,
<BR>Sailor, Sailor...

<H3><A NAME="traveler"></A>The Traveller</H3>

In from the coast, riding like the wind and racing the moon,
<BR>Shadows on the road, dancing and a-weaving like a crazy fool.
<BR>A horseman is coming, death in his heart, for a rendez-vous,
<BR>And where the traveller goes, nobody knows,
<BR>Where the traveller goes, nobody knows....

<P>A candle in the night, fear on every face when he goes inside
<BR>(Maybe he's on the run?)
<BR>Get back from the bar! A stranger in town is a dangerous sight
<BR>(Maybe he's got a gun?)
<BR>"Bring a bottle of whisky, ladlord, I wanna talk for a while."
<BR>And where the traveller goes, a cold wind blows,
<BR>Oh, where the traveller goes, a cold wind blows....

<P>There is something in his eyes, something in his hands,
<BR>You can almost smell his revenge!
<BR>And whoever he is after, it will be disaster:
<BR>This man is gonna take him to the very end....

<P>Well, the landlord he trembled, staring at a face he'd seen somewhere before.
<BR>(You laid him in the ground)
<BR>Suddenly remembers a killing, yes, a murder, many years before.
<BR>('Twas you that shot him down)
<BR>He said to a boy: "Saddle me the black, I'll meet you down below.
<BR>With this man I must talk, yes with this traveller I'll go,
<BR>With this man I must talk, yes with him I must go."

<P>There is something in his eyes, something in his hands,
<BR>I can almost smell his revenge!
<BR>And it's me that he's after, it will be disaster:
<BR>This man is gonna take me to the very end....

<P>And they where never seen again!
