this man I married is buried deep
<BR>and the more I try to wake him, the more he sleeps
<BR>I used to think I knew this man
<BR>the tenderness, not the back of his hand

<P>it's been two weeks since he last had a drink
<BR>but the time bombs ticking, I can never sleep
<BR>it would be easier if he did
<BR>why do you stay here, stay with him?

<P>why do you do it?
<BR>why do you treat us bad?
<BR>when you've got two kids that love you
<BR>and a wife that's missing you bad
<BR>I've got to go now
<BR>I've got to say goodbye
<BR>don't try to stop us now
<BR>and please don't you cry
<BR>can't you see. we've all been through it
<BR>it's all been said before
<BR>with all these fears,
<BR>for how many years can I keep coming
<BR>back for more
<BR>no more

<P>must be addicted to all this pain
<BR>cause I keep coming back for the shame
<BR>dear god give me the strength to leave
<BR>I've got to keep going, keep going this time

<P>don't try to stop us now
<BR>don't pull that stuff on me
<BR>I've got the kids all packed up
<BR>harry's in the back with his pick up truck
<BR>jenny's fallen asleep again
<BR>I've got to keep driving till i reach the end

<P>I can't come back here anymore
<BR>and I know it
<BR>and I know it
<BR>I can't come back here anymore
<BR>and I know it
<BR>and I know it

I'd like to get next to you
<BR>if you want me to

<P>I could hold you
<BR>maybe I could show you
<BR>but I'm afraid
<BR>cause you see I have been hurt before
<BR>though I don't want to hurt no more
<BR>this feeling inside of me
<BR>is strong in me
<BR>is strong in me
<BR>could you tell me who you are
<BR>and would I really want to know
<BR>what's it been for you
<BR>just to trust and hold on, too

<P>I'd like to get next to you
<BR>whenever you wnated to
<BR>I'd like to get next to you
<BR>whenever you wanted to

<P>you could hold me
<BR>maybe you could show me
<BR>how to trust
<BR>cause you see I have been hurt before
<BR>though I don't want to hurt no more
<BR>this feeling inside of me
<BR>is strong in me
<BR>is strong in me
<BR>could I tell you who I am
<BR>and would you really want to know
<BR>what it's been for me
<BR>just to trust and to believe

<P>could I show you who I am
<BR>would you really want to understand
<BR>holding skin to skin
<BR>my emotion feels like it has no end
<BR>could I show you myself
<BR>could I get right next to you,
<BR>next to you

children laugh
<BR>children cry
<BR>they're the future of our time
<BR>will they hold us to blame
<BR>for all the things we've turned away
<BR>I don't like what I see now
<BR>I don't like where we're going
<BR>I don't like it, no
<BR>you and I, we're getting older now
<BR>you and I, who will show them

<P>I want to know is it true
<BR>is there a house of hope for me and you
<BR>I want to know is it true
<BR>is there a house of hope for me and you

<P>children laugh
<BR>children cry
<BR>they're the ones who will survive
<BR>will they know what we've sold
<BR>nature's gift we've turned for gold
<BR>I don't like what I see now
<BR>in my life, what I see now
<BR>I don't like where we're going
<BR>I don't like it, no
<BR>you and I, we're getting older now

while you're standing there
<BR>I'm standing in a field
<BR>in my mind
<BR>you can't take that away from me
<BR>daddy comes to me
<BR>in darkness not in light
<BR>why I gave you all my love
<BR>and you showed no mercy

<P>you tried to pin me down
<BR>with emotion feeling things
<BR>a butterfly display
<BR>a symbol fall from grace
<BR>I'm closing down my heart
<BR>I'm putting up the wall
<BR>why I gave you all my love
<BR>and you showed no mercy

<P>here I sit
<BR>looking to the light
<BR>in my head
<BR>I have the peace of mind
<BR>I've lost tonight
<BR>there are flowers here
<BR>and hills and horses too
<BR>I ride in my dreams and
<BR>I'm afraid I'll have to go back
<BR>go back to the night
<BR>daddy holds me tight
<BR>I'm losing my mind
<BR>I'm losing my head
<BR>someone help me now
<BR>daddy comes to me
<BR>in darkness not in light
<BR>why I gave you all my love
<BR>and you showed no mercy

<P>I just want to know now
<BR>what it is to survive
<BR>daddy's song and daddy's lies
<BR>I've gotta know (repeat)
<BR>what it is
<BR>how it happened
<BR>I've just got to know now
<BR>what it is to survive
<BR>daddy's song and daddy's lies
<BR>I've gotta know (repeat)

<P>what it is
<BR>how it happened
<BR>I've just got to know now
<BR>what it means to survive
<BR>and to live out daddy's lies
<BR>I've got to live
<BR>I've got to live
<BR>I've got to live
<BR>I've got to live

<H3><A NAME="5"></A>Heaven's Gate</H3>

a man I met in my youth
<BR>came to me in the light of truth
<BR>a beautiful dream that was
<BR>till he died one rainy fall
<BR>there I was a child bride
<BR>widowed at ninteen, defied
<BR>never would I let him go
<BR>go to the place that heaven knows

<P>on the evening of his death
<BR>my shoulders felt a brushing breath
<BR>cold were his hands on my breast
<BR>the man that I loved and put to rest
<BR>he came to me and held me close
<BR>we danced til dawn in the early snow
<BR>there I felt him cry and cry
<BR>"I'll never leave, leave your side"

<P>oh the madness
<BR>this town thinks I'm mad
<BR>sixty years, has it been a dream
<BR>this man I'm haunted by, I see

<P>I'm eighty years and on my bed
<BR>awaiting death, that final breath
<BR>he sits by and looks to me
<BR>"soon you will come and be with me"
<BR>now I feel all warm inside
<BR>as I leave this mortal body behind
<BR>seems it is eternal's way
<BR>we're waltzing into heaven's gate

<H3><A NAME="6"></A>The Dead Are Dancing</H3>

I see a graveyard's past
<BR>the revolution's taken back
<BR>whatever happened to the sons
<BR>no more sunshine here
<BR>only darkness here
<BR>there's no-one living in this town

<P>cause the dead are dancing
<BR>the dead are dancing
<BR>the dead are dancing
<BR>in the town

<P>mother mary comes to me
<BR>in this graveyard of hypocricy
<BR>but father renta says I'll have to pay
<BR>in the dead are buried lies
<BR>a sinful phantom cries
<BR>can't we just rest up on the hill

<P>but the moonlight calls us
<BR>the moon, it calls us
<BR>up and out into the town
<BR>yes, the dead are dancing
<BR>the dead are dancing
<BR>the dead are dancing
<BR>in the town

<P>heaven does it come to me
<BR>in the dreaming that my soul's been freed
<BR>and the torment of my madness gone away
<BR>and though god says he loves
<BR>and I, I think of love
<BR>i cannot change the way I am

<P>and so the moon, it calls me
<BR>the lunatic calls me
<BR>up and out into the town
<BR>yes, the dead are dancing
<BR>the dead are dancing
<BR>the dead are dancing
<BR>in the town

<H3><A NAME="7"></A>I Want To Walk With You</H3>

I keep finding this decision hard
<BR>I keep finding a room that's in the dark
<BR>I don't know, shed some light on it
<BR>maybe save me from what I'm feeling
<BR>this lonely day
<BR>cause the secret's out and the secret's clear
<BR>what I want

<P>yes I want to walk with you
<BR>I want to hear you say "yes I want that too"
<BR>I want to walk, I want to walk with you
<BR>I want to hear you say "yes I want that too"

<P>can I tell you what I cannot tell myself
<BR>in my thoughts there's a voice calling
<BR>"you will be lost"
<BR>in my life I deny, deny this heavy load
<BR>and obsession is clearly my need to know
<BR>can I let it out, can I let you know
<BR>what I want

<P>I don't want to run from this
<BR>it seems that it'd be hard to do now
<BR>I don't want to lose my head
<BR>falling down in front of you
<BR>I don't want to lose my head now
<BR>it could be so easy to do
<BR>if I could find a reason why
<BR>I'd stay here, stay here, stay here
<BR>stay here, stay

<P>I want to give love
<BR>I want to share
<BR>I want to show you just how much I care
<BR>I want to hold you
<BR>I want to touch
<BR>I want to give my love away
<BR>I want to walk
<BR>I want to walk
<BR>I want to know what it is in my soul

<BR>help me please to find

<P>innocence is lost on the small

I walk away
<BR>it seems it's like a bad day
<BR>on the hill
<BR>I stand and stare away
<BR>hoping for a brighter day

<P>and I stand staring there
<BR>and I stand staring there today

<P>I feel the rain
<BR>fall upon my face and wash away
<BR>the things I feel inside
<BR>turmoil is what moves the tides

<P>and I stand staring there
<BR>and I stand staring there
<BR>and I begin another day

<P>you say you hurt
<BR>and the cut has been too deep
<BR>the blood
<BR>that flows inside your soul has died
<BR>cancer is the hurt inside

<P>and I can't walk away
<BR>and I can't show the pain
<BR>and I can't let it go
<BR>and I can't let it go away

<P>it's another day
<BR>the morning comes so bright
<BR>I feel lifted
<BR>now the clouds have passed
<BR>I feel freedom here at last
