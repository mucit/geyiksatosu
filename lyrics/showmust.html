<H2>The Show Must Go On</H2>

<B><I>Queen</I></B>

<P>Empty spaces - what are we living for
<BR>Abandoned places - I guess we know the score
<BR>On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for...

<P>Another hero, another mindless crime
<BR>Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
<BR>Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore

<P>The show must go on,
<BR>The show must go on

<P>Inside my heart is breaking
<BR>My make-up may be flaking
<BR>But my smile still stays on.

<P>Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
<BR>Another heartache, another failed romance
<BR>On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?

<P>I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now
<BR>I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
<BR>Outside the dawn is breaking
<BR>But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

<P>The show must go on
<BR>The show must go on

<P>Inside my heart is breaking
<BR>My make-up may be flaking
<BR>But my smile still stays on

<P>My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
<BR>Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
<BR>I can fly - my friends

<P>The show must go on
<BR>The show must go on
<BR>I'll face it with a grin
<BR>I'm never giving in

<P>On - with the show -
<BR>I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
<BR>I have to find the will to carry on
<BR>On with the -
<BR>On with the show -

<P>The show must go on...
