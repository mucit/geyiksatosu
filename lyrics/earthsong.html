<H2>EARTH SONG</H2>
<B><I>Michael Jackson</I></B>


<P>What about sunrise
<BR>What about rain
<BR>What about all the things
<BR>That you said we were to gain...
<BR>What about killing fields
<BR>Is there a time
<BR>What about all the things
<BR>That you said was yours and mine...
<BR>Did you ever stop to notice
<BR>All the blood we've shed before
<BR>Did you ever stop to notice
<BR>The crying Earth the weeping shores?

<P>Aaaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaaah

<P>What have we done to the world
<BR>Look what we've done
<BR>What about all the peace
<BR>That you pledge your only son...
<BR>What about flowering fields
<BR>Is there a time
<BR>What about all the dreams
<BR>That you said was yours and mine...
<BR>Did you ever stop to notice
<BR>All the children dead from war
<BR>Did you ever stop to notice
<BR>The crying Earth the weeping shores

<P>Aaaaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaaaah

<P>I used to dream
<BR>I used to glance beyond the stars
<BR>Now I don't know where we are
<BR>Although I know we've drifted far

<P>Aaaaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaaaaah
<BR>Aaaaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaaaaah

<P>Hey, what about yesterday
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>What about the seas
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>The heavens are falling down
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>I can't even breathe
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>What about the bleeding Earth
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>Can't we feel its wounds
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>What about nature's worth
<BR>(ooo, ooo)
<BR>It's our planet's womb
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>What about animals
<BR>(What about it)
<BR>We've turned kingdoms to dust
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>What about elephants
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>Have we lost their trust
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>What about crying whales
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>We're ravaging the seas
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>What about forest trails
<BR>(ooo, ooo)
<BR>Burnt despite our pleas
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>What about the holy land
<BR>(What about it)
<BR>Torn apart by creed
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>What about the common man
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>Can't we set him free
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>What about children dying
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>Can't you hear them cry
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>Where did we go wrong
<BR>(ooo, ooo)
<BR>Someone tell me why
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>What about babies
<BR>(What about it)
<BR>What about the days
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>What about all their joy
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>What about the man
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>What about the crying man
<BR>(What about us)
<BR>What about Abraham
<BR>(What was us)
<BR>What about death again
<BR>(ooo, ooo)
<BR>Do we give a damn

<P>Aaaaaaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaaaaaah
