<H2>Strangers In The Night</H2>

Strangers in the night exchanging glances
<BR>Wond'ring in the night
<BR>What were the chances we'd be sharing love
<BR>Before the night was through.

<P>Something in your eyes was so inviting,
<BR>Something in you smile was so exciting,
<BR>Something in my heart,
<BR>Told me I must have you.

<P>Strangers in the night, two lonely people
<BR>We were strangers in the night
<BR>Up to the moment
<BR>When we said our first hello.
<BR>Little did we know
<BR>Love was just a glance away,
<BR>A warm embracing dance away and -

<P>Ever since that night we've been together.
<BR>Lovers at first sight, in love forever.
<BR>It turned out so right,
<BR>For strangers in the night.
