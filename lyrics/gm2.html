<H2>Jesus To A Child</H2>
<I><B>George Michael</B></I>

<P>Kindness
<BR>In your eyes
<BR>I guess
<BR>You heard me cry
<BR>You smiled at me
<BR>Like Jesus to a child

<P>I'm blessed
<BR>I know
<BR>Heaven sent
<BR>And Heaven stole
<BR>You smiled at me
<BR>Like Jesus to a child

<P>And what have I learned
<BR>From all this pain
<BR>I thought I'd never feel the same
<BR>About anyone
<BR>Or anything again

<P>But now I know
<BR>When you find love
<BR>When you know that it exists
<BR>Then the lover that you miss
<BR>Will come to you on those cold, cold nights

<P>When you've been loved
<BR>When you know it holds such bliss
<BR>Then the lover that you kissed
<BR>Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

<P>Sadness
<BR>In my eyes
<BR>No one guessed
<BR>Or no one tried
<BR>You smiled at me
<BR>Like Jesus to a child

<P>Loveless and cold
<BR>With your last breath
<BR>You saved my soul
<BR>You smiled at me
<BR>Like Jesus to a child

<P>And what have I learned
<BR>From all these tears
<BR>I've waited for you all those years
<BR>And just when it began
<BR>He took you away

<P>But I still say
<BR>When you find love
<BR>When you know that it exists
<BR>Then the lover that you miss
<BR>Will come to you on those cold, cold nights

<P>When you've been loved
<BR>When you know it holds such bliss
<BR>Then the lover that you kissed
<BR>Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

<P>So the words you could not say
<BR>I'll sing them for you
<BR>And the love we would have made
<BR>I'll make it for two

<P>For every single memory
<BR>Has become a part of me
<BR>You will always be
<BR>My love

<P>Well I've been loved
<BR>So I know just what love is
<BR>And the lover that I kissed
<BR>Is always by my side

<P>Oh the lover I still miss
<BR>Was Jesus to a child
