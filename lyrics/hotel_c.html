<P>On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
<BR>Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
<BR>Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
<BR>My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night

<P>There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
<BR>And I was thinking to myself,
<BR>'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell'
<BR>Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
<BR>There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say...

<P>Welcome to the Hotel California
<BR>Such a lovely place
<BR>Such a lovely face
<BR>Plenty of room at the Hotel California
<BR>Any time of year, you can find it here

<P>Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
<BR>She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
<BR>How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
<BR>Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

<P>So I called up the Captain,
<BR>'Please bring me my wine' He said,
<BR>'We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine'
<BR>And still those voices are calling from far away,
<BR>Wake you up in the middle of the night Just to hear them say...

<P>Welcome to the Hotel California
<BR>Such a lovely place
<BR>Such a lovely face
<BR>They livin' it up at the Hotel California
<BR>What a nice surprise, bring your alibis

<P>Mirrors on the ceiling,
<BR>The pink champagne on ice
<BR>And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
<BR>And in the master's chambers,
<BR>They gathered for the feast
<BR>The stab it with their steely knives,
<BR>But they just can't kill the beast

<P>Last thing I remember, I was
<BR>Running for the door I had to find the passage back
<BR>To the place I was before 'Relax,'said the night man,
<BR>We are programmed to receive.
<BR>You can checkout any time you like, but you can never leave!
