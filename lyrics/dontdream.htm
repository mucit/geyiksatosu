<H2>Don't Dream It's Over</H2>

<B><I>Crowded House</I></B>

<center>
<P>There is freedom within, there is freedom without
<BR>Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
<BR>There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
<BR>But you'll never see the end of the road
<BR>While you're travelling with me

<P>Hey now, hey now
<BR>Don't dream it's over
<BR>Hey now, hey now
<BR>When the world comes in
<BR>They come, they come
<BR>To build a world between us
<BR>We know they won't win

<P>Now I'm towing my car, there's a whole in the roof
<BR>My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
<BR>In the paper today tales of war and of waste
<BR>But you turn right over to the T.V. page

<P>Hey now, hey now
<BR>Don't dream it's over
<BR>Hey now, hey now
<BR>When the world comes in
<BR>They come, they come
<BR>To build a world between us
<BR>We know they won't win

<P>Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
<BR>And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
<BR>Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
<BR>Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

<P>Hey now, hey now
<BR>Don't dream it's over
<BR>Hey now, hey now
<BR>When the world comes in
<BR>They come, they come
<BR>To build a wall between us
<BR>Don't ever let them win
