<H2>
It's No Good</H2>

<P>I'm going to take my time
<BR>I have all the time in the world
<BR>To make you mine
<BR>It is written in the stars above
<BR>The gods decree
<BR>You'll be right here by my side
<BR>Right next to me
<BR>You can run but you cannot hide

<P>Don't say you want me
<BR>Don't say you need me
<BR>Don't say you love me
<BR>It's understood
<BR>Don't say you're happy
<BR>Out there without me
<BR>I know you can't be
<BR>'Cause it's no good

<P>I'll be fine
<BR>I'll be waiting patiently
<BR>Till you see the signs
<BR>And come running to my open arms
<BR>When will you realize
<BR>Do we have to wait 'till our worlds collide
<BR>Open up your eyes
<BR>You can't turn back the tide

<P>Don't say you want me
<BR>Don't say you need me
<BR>Don't say you love me
<BR>It's understood
<BR>Don't say you're happy
<BR>Out there without me
<BR>I know you can't be
<BR>'Cause it's no good

<P>I'm going to take my time
<BR>I have all the time in the world
<BR>To make you mine
<BR>It is written in the stars above

<P>Don't say you want me
<BR>Don't say you need me
<BR>Don't say you love me
<BR>It's understood
<BR>Don't say you're happy
<BR>Out there without me
<BR>I know you can't be
<BR>'Cause it's no good
