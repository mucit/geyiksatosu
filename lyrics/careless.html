<H2>Careless Whisper</H2>

<B><I>Wham</I></B>

<P>Time can never mend
<BR>The careless whispers of a good friend
<BR>To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
<BR>There's no comfort in the truth
<BR>Pain is all you'll find
<BR>I should've known better

<P>I feel so unsure, as I take your hand
<BR>And lead you to the dance floor
<BR>As the music dies, something in your eyes
<BR>Calls to mind the silver screen
<BR>And all its sad goodbyes

<P>Chorus :

<P>I'm never gonna dance again
<BR>Guilty feet have got no rhythm
<BR>Though it's easy to pretend
<BR>I know you're not a fool
<BR>Should've known better than to cheat a friend
<BR>And waste the chance that I've been given
<BR>So I'm never gonna dance again
<BR>The way I danced with you

<P>Tonight the music seems so loud
<BR>I wish that we could lose this crowd
<BR>Maybe it's better this way
<BR>We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say
<BR>We could have been so good together
<BR>We could have lived this dance forever
<BR>But now who's gonna dance with me
<BR>Please stay

<P>(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone
<BR>(Now that you're gone) What I did's so wrong
<BR>that you had to leave me alone ...
