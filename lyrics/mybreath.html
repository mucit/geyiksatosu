<H2>Take My Breath Away</H2>
<I><B>performed by: Berlin
<BR>written by: Giorgio Moroder/Tom Whitlock</B></I>

<P>Watching every motion
<BR>In my foolish lover's game
<BR>On this endless ocean
<BR>Finally lovers know no shame
<BR>Turning and returning
<BR>To some secret place inside
<BR>Watching in slow motion
<BR>As you turn around and say

<P>Take my breath away
<BR>Take my breath away

<P>Watching I keep waiting
<BR>Still anticipating love
<BR>Never hesitating
<BR>To become the fated ones
<BR>Turning and returning
<BR>To some secret place to hide
<BR>Watching in slow motion
<BR>As you turn to me and say

<P>Take my breath away

<P>Through the hourglass I saw you
<BR>In time you slipped away
<BR>When the mirror crashed I called you
<BR>And turned to hear you say
<BR>If only for today
<BR>I am unafraid

<P>Take my breath away

<P>Watching every motion
<BR>In this foolish lover's game
<BR>Haunted by the notion
<BR>Somewhere there's a love in flames
<BR>Turning and returning
<BR>To some secret place inside
<BR>Watching in slow motion
<BR>As you turn my way and say

<P>Take my breath away
