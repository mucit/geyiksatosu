<P>Don't leave me in all this pain
<BR>Don't leave me out in the rain
<BR>Come back and bring back my smile
<BR>Come and take the tears away
<BR>I need your arms to hold me now
<BR>The nights are so unkind
<BR>Bring back those nights when I held you beside me

<BR>CHORUS:
<DD>Un-break my heart
<DD>Say you'll love me again
<DD>Undo this hurt you caused
<DD>When you walked out the door
<DD>And walked outta my life
<DD>Un-cry these tears
<DD>I cried so many nights
<DD>Un-break my heart
<DD>My heart

<P>Take back that sad word good-bye
<BR>Bring back the joy to my life
<BR>Don't leave me here with these tears
<BR>Come and kiss this pain away
<BR>I can't forget the day you left
<BR>Time is so unkind
<BR>And life is so cruel without you here beside me
