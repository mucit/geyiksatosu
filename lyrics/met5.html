<H2>Until It Sleeps</H2>

<P>Where do I take this pain of mine
<BR>I run but it stays right by my side

<P>So tear me open, pour me out
<BR>The things inside that scream and shout

<P>And the pain still hates me
<BR>So hold me until it sleeps

<P>Just like a curse, just like a stray
<BR>You feed it once and now it stays
<BR>Now it stays

<P>So tear me open, but beware
<BR>The things inside without a care
<BR>And the dirt still stains me
<BR>So wash me until I'm clean

<P>It grips you solely
<BR>It stains you solely
<BR>It hates you solely
<BR>It holds you solely
<BR>Until it sleeps...

<P>So tell me why you've choosen me
<BR>Don't want your grip

<P>Don't want your greed
<BR>Don't want it

<P>Tear me open, make you gone
<BR>No more can you hurt anyone
<BR>And the fear still shakes me
<BR>So hold me until it sleeps

<P>I don't want it.....NO

<P>It grips you soley
<BR>It stains you solely
<BR>It hates you solely
<BR>It holds you, holds you, holds you
<BR>Until it sleeps...

<P>So tear me open, but beware
<BR>The things inside without a care
<BR>And the dirt still stains me
<BR>So wash me til I'm clean

<P>Tear me open, make you gone
<BR>No longer will you hurt anyone
<BR>And the fear still shakes me
<BR>So hold me until it sleeps
<BR>Until it sleeps
<BR>Until it sleeps
<BR>Until it sleeps
