<P>He's laughing with another girl
<BR>And playing with another heart.
<BR>Placing high stakes, making hearts ache.
<BR>He's loved in seven languages.
<BR>Diamond nights and ruby lights, high in the sky.
<BR>Heaven help him, when he falls.

<P>Diamond life, lover boy.
<BR>We move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy.
<BR>City lights and business nights.
<BR>When you require streetcar desire for higher heights.<

<P>No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
<BR>When sentiment is left to chance.
<BR>No place to be ending but somewhere to start.

<P>No need to ask.
<BR>He's a smooth operator,
<BR>smooth operator,
<BR>smooth operator,
<BR>smooth operator.

<P>Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male.
<BR>Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale.

<P>Face to face, each classic case.
<BR>We shadow box and double cross,
<BR>Yet need the chase.

<P>A license to love, insurance to hold.
<BR>Melts all your memories and change into gold.
<BR>His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold.

<P>No need to ask.
<BR>He's a smooth operator,
<BR>smooth operator,
<BR>smooth operator,
<BR>smooth operator.

<P>Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male.
<BR>Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale.

<P>Smooth operator,
<BR>smooth operator,
<BR>smooth operator,
<BR>smooth operator,
<BR>smooth operator...
