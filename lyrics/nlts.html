The Lazarus Heart</H2>
He looked beneath his shirt today
<BR>There was a wound in his flesh so deep and wide
<BR>From the wound a lovely flower grew
<BR>From somewhere deep inside
<BR>He turned around to face his mother
<BR>To show her the wound in his breast that burned like a brand
<BR>But the sword that cut him open
<BR>Was the sword in his mother's hand

<P>Every day another miracle
<BR>Only death will tear us apart
<BR>To sacrifice a life for yours
<BR>I'd be the blood of the Lazarus heart
<BR>The blood of the Lazarus heart

<P>Though the sword was his protection
<BR>The wound itself would give him power
<BR>The power to remake himself
<BR>at the time of his darkest hour
<BR>She said the wound would give him courage and pain
<BR>The kind of pain that you can't hide
<BR>From the wound a lovely flower grew
<BR>From somewhere deep inside

<P>Every day another miracle
<BR>Only death will keep us apart
<BR>To sacrifice a life for yours
<BR>I'd be the blood of the Lazarus heart
<BR>The blood of the Lazarus heart

<P>Birds on the roof of my mother's house
<BR>I've no stones that chase them away
<BR>Birds on the roof of my mother's house
<BR>Will sit on my roof someday
<BR>They fly at the window, they fly at the door
<BR>Where does she get the strength to fight them anymore
<BR>She counts all her children as a shield against the rain
<BR>Lifts her eyes to the sky like a flower to the rain

<P>Every day another miracle
<BR>Only death will keep us apart
<BR>To sacrifice a life for yours
<BR>I'd be the blood of the Lazarus heart
<BR>The blood of the Lazarus heart

Be Still My Beating Heart</H2>
Be still my beating heart
<BR>It would be better to be cool
<BR>It's not time to be open just yet
<BR>A lesson once learned is so hard to forget
<BR>Be still my beating heart
<BR>Or I'll be taken for a fool
<BR>It's not healthy to run at this pace
<BR>The blood runs so red to my face
<BR>I've been to every single book I know
<BR>To soothe the thoughts that plague me so

<P>I sink like a stone that's been thrown in the ocean
<BR>My logic has drowned in a sea of emotion
<BR>Stop before you start
<BR>Be still my beating heart

<P>Be still my beating heart
<BR>You must learn to stand your ground
<BR>It's not healthy to run at this pace
<BR>The blood runs so red to my face
<BR>I've been to every single book I know
<BR>To soothe the thoughts that plague me so
<BR>Stop before you start
<BR>Be still my beating heart

<P>Never to be wrong
<BR>Never to make promises that break
<BR>It's like singing in the wind
<BR>Or writing on the surface of a lake
<BR>And I wriggle like a fish caught on dry land
<BR>Struggle to avoid any help at hand

<P>I sink like a stone that's been thrown in the ocean
<BR>My logic has drowned in a sea of emotion
<BR>Stop before you start
<BR>Be still my beating heart

Englishman In New York</H2>
I don't drink coffee I take tea my dear
<BR>I like my toast done on the side
<BR>And you can hear it in my accent when I talk
<BR>I'm an Englishman in New York

<P>See me walking down Fifth Avenue
<BR>A walking cane here at my side
<BR>I take it everywhere I walk
<BR>I'm an Englishman in New York

<P>I'm an alien
<BR>I'm a legal alien
<BR>I'm an Englishman in New York

<P>If "manners maketh man" as someone said
<BR>Then he's the hero of the day
<BR>It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
<BR>Be yourself no matter what they say

<BR>I'm an Englishman in New York
<BR>I'm an alien

<P>Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety
<BR>You could end up as the only one
<BR>Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society
<BR>At night a candle's brighter than the sun

<P>Takes more than combat gear to make a man
<BR>Takes more than license for a gun
<BR>Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
<BR>A gentleman will walk but never run

<P>If "manners maketh man" as someone said
<BR>Then he's the hero of the day
<BR>It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
<BR>Be yourself no matter what they say

<BR>I'm an Englishman in New York

History Will Teach Us Nothing</H2>
If we seek solace in the prisons of the distant past
<BR>Security in human systems we're told will always always last
<BR>Emotions are the sail and blind faith is the mast
<BR>Without the breath of real freedom we're getting nowhere fast

<P>If God is dead and an actor plays his part
<BR>His words of fear will find a place in your heart
<BR>Without the voice of reason every faith is its own curse
<BR>Without freedom from the past things can only get worse

<P>Sooner or later just like the world first day
<BR>Sooner or later we learn to throw the past away
<BR>Sooner or later just like the world first day
<BR>Sooner or later we learn to throw the past away
<BR>Sooner or later we learn to throw the past away

<P>History will teach us nothing
<BR>History will teach us nothing

<P>Our written history is a catalogue of crime
<BR>The sordid and the powerful, the architects of time
<BR>The mother of invention, the oppression of the mild
<BR>The constant fear of scarcity, aggression as its child

<P>Sooner or later
<BR>Sooner or later
<BR>Sooner or later
<BR>Sooner or later

<P>Convince an enemy, convince him that he's wrong
<BR>Is to win a bloodless battle where victory is long
<BR>A simple act of faith
<BR>In reason over might
<BR>To blow up his children will only prove him right
<BR>History will teach us nothing
<BR>Sooner or later just like the world first day
<BR>Sooner or later we learn to throw the past away
<BR>Sooner or later just like the world first day
<BR>Sooner or later we learn to throw the past away
<BR>Sooner or later we learn to throw the past away

<BR>History will teach us nothing

They Dance Alone (Gueca Solo)</H2>
Why are these women here dancing on their own?
<BR>Why is there this sadness in their eyes?
<BR>Why are the soldiers here
<BR>Their faces fixed like stone?
<BR>I can't see what it is they despise
<BR>They're dancing with the missing
<BR>They're dancing with the dead
<BR>They dance with the invisible ones
<BR>Their anguish is unsaid
<BR>They're dancing with their fathers
<BR>They're dancing with their sons
<BR>They're dancing with their husbands
<BR>They dance alone
<BR>They dance alone

<P>It's the only form of protest they're allowed
<BR>I've seen their silent faces scream so loud
<BR>If they were to speak these words
<BR>they'd go missing too
<BR>Another woman on the torture table
<BR>what else can they do
<BR>They're dancing with the missing
<BR>They're dancing with the dead
<BR>They dance with the invisible ones
<BR>Their anguish is unsaid
<BR>They're dancing with their fathers
<BR>They're dancing with their sons
<BR>They're dancing with their husbands
<BR>They dance alone
<BR>They dance alone

<P>One day we'll dance on their graves
<BR>One day we'll sing our freedom
<BR>One day we'll laugh in our joy
<BR>And we'll dance
<BR>One day we'll dance on their graves
<BR>One day we'll sing our freedom
<BR>One day we'll laugh in our joy
<BR>And we'll dance

<P><I>Ellas danzan con los desaparecidos</I>

<P>Hey Mr. Pinochet
<BR>You've sown a bitter crop
<BR>It's foreign money that supports you
<BR>One day the money's going to stop
<BR>No wages for your torturers
<BR>No budget for your guns
<BR>Can you think of your own mother
<BR>Dancin' with her invisible son
<BR>They're dancing with the missing
<BR>They're dancing with the dead
<BR>They dance with the invisible ones
<BR>Their anguish is unsaid
<BR>They're dancing with their fathers

Fragile</H2>
If blood will flow when flesh and steel are one
<BR>Drying in the colour of the evening sun
<BR>Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
<BR>But something in our minds will always stay

<P>Perhaps this final act was meant
<BR>To clinch a lifetime's argument
<BR>That nothing comes from violence
<BR>and nothing ever could
<BR>For all those born beneath an angry star
<BR>Lest we forget how fragile we are

<P>On and on the rain will fall
<BR>Like tears from a star
<BR>Like tears from a star
<BR>On and on the rain will say
<BR>How fragile we are
<BR>How fragile we are

<P>On and on the rain will fall
<BR>Like tears from a star
<BR>Like tears from a star
<BR>On and on the rain will say

Straight To My Heart</H2>
Well in a hundred years from now
<BR>They will attempt to tell us how
<BR>A scientific means to bliss
<BR>Will supercede the human kiss

<P>A sub atomic chain
<BR>Will maybe galvanize the brain
<BR>A biochemic trance
<BR>Will eliminate romance

<P>But why ever should we care
<BR>When there are arrows in the air
<BR>Formed by lovers' ancient art
<BR>That go straight to my heart

<P>A future sugar coated pill
<BR>Would give our lovers time to kill
<BR>I think they're working far too much
<BR>For the redundancy of touch

<P>But what will make me yours
<BR>Are a million deadly spores
<BR>Formed by lovers' ancient art
<BR>That go straight to my heart

<P>Come into my door
<BR>Be the light of my life
<BR>Come into my door

<P>You'll never have to sweep the floor
<BR>Come into my door
<BR>Be the light of my life
<BR>Come into my door
<BR>Come and be my wife
<BR>I'll be true. To no one but you

<P>If it's a future world we fear
<BR>We have tomorrow's seeds right here
<BR>For you can hold them in your hand
<BR>Or let them fall into the sand

<P>But if our love is pure
<BR>The only thing of which we're sure
<BR>Then you can play your part
<BR>And go straight to my heart

<P>If I should seek immunity
<BR>And love you with impunity
<BR>Then the only thing to do
<BR>Is for me to pledge myself to you

<P>But they only dealt one card
<BR>So for me it is not hard
<BR>You're the bright star in my chart
<BR>You go straight to my heart

<P>Come into my door
<BR>Be the light of my life
<BR>Come into my door
<BR>You'll never have to sweep the floor
<BR>Come into my door
<BR>Be the light of my life
<BR>Come into my door
<BR>Come and be my wife
<BR>I'll be true. To no one but you

Rock Steady</H2>
Saw an ad in the newspaper that caught my eye
<BR>I said to my baby this sounds like the ticket for you and I
<BR>It said volunteers wanted for a very special trip
<BR>To commune with Mother Nature on a big wooden ship
<BR>We took a taxi to the river in case any places were free
<BR>There was an old guy with a beard
<BR>And every kind of creature as far as the eye could see

<P>This old guy was the boss, he said, "I won't tell you no lie
<BR>But there's more to this journey than is apparent to the eye"
<BR>He said he'd heard God's message on the radio
<BR>It was going to rain forever and he'd told him to go
<BR>"I'll protect you all don't worry I'll be father to you all
<BR>I'll save two of every animal, no matter how small
<BR>But I'll need some assistants to look after the zoo
<BR>I can't see nobody better so you'll just have to do"
<BR>I said, "Just tell me something before it's too late and we're gone
<BR>I mean just how safe is this boat we'll be on?"

<P>"It's Rock steady / Rock steady
<BR>Rock steady / Rock steady
<BR>Rock steady / Rock steady
<BR>Rock steady / Rock steady"

<P>It rained for forty days and forty long nights
<BR>I'd never seen rain like it and it looked like our old friend
<BR>Was being proved right
<BR>We had no time to worry though there was just too much to do
<BR>Between the signified monkey and the kangaroo
<BR>We had to wash all the animals we had to feed them too
<BR>We were merely human slaves in a big floating zoo
<BR>She said, "Hey baby I don't mean to be flip
<BR>But it seems this old man is on some power trip"
<BR>I said, "No, no sugar you must be wrong
<BR>I mean look at the size of this boat we're on.
<BR>We're as safe as houses, as safe as mother's milk
<BR>He's as cool as November and as smooth as China silk
<BR>He's God's best friend, he's got a seat on the board
<BR>And life may be tough but we're sailing with the lord."

<P>Rock steady / Rock steady
<BR>Rock steady / Rock steady
<BR>Rock steady / Rock steady
<BR>Rock steady / Rock steady

<P>Woke up this morning and something had changed
<BR>Like a room in my house had just been rearranged
<BR>She said, "It's stopped raining and I know the guy's kind
<BR>But if we stay here much longer I'm gonna lose my mind."
<BR>So we said we had a mission for his favorite dove
<BR>To see if there was any mercy from this great God above
<BR>So to find dry land, away the white bird flew
<BR>We didn't need no country just a rock would do
<BR>When the dove came back to us he threw down a twig
<BR>It was manna from heaven and meant we could blow this gig
<BR>"But the rock's too small," he said, "can't you see?"
<BR>I said, "It's just perfect for her, it's perfect for me."

<P>Rock steady / Rock steady
<BR>Rock steady / Rock steady
<BR>Rock steady / Rock steady
<BR>Rock steady / Rock steady
<BR>Rock steady / Rock steady
