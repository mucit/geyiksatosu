Words like violence
<BR>Break the silence
<BR>Come crashing in
<BR>Into my little world

<P>Painful to me
<BR>Pierce right through me
<BR>Can't you understand
<BR>Oh my little girl

<P>All I ever wanted
<BR>All I ever needed
<BR>Is here in my arms
<BR>Words are very unnecessary
<BR>They can only do harm

<P>Vows are spoken
<BR>To be broken
<BR>Feelings are intense
<BR>Words are trivial
<BR>Pleasures remain
<BR>So does the pain
<BR>Words are meaningless
<BR>And forgettable

<P>All I ever wanted
<BR>All I ever needed
<BR>Is here in my arms
<BR>Words are very unnecessary
<BR>They can only do harm

<P>Enjoy the silence
