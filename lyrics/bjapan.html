<P>Winter's cityside
<BR>Crystal bits of snowflakes
<BR>All around my head and in the wind
<BR>I had no illusions
<BR>That I'd ever find a glimpse
<BR>Of summer's heatwaves in your eyes
<BR>You did what you did to me
<BR>Now it's history, I see
<BR>Here's my comeback on the road again
<BR>Things will happen while they can
<BR>I will wait here for my man tonight
<BR>It's easy when you're big in Japan

<P>Aah when you're big in Japan-tonight...
<BR>Big in Japan-be-tight...
<BR>Big in Japan...ooh the eastern sea's so blue
<BR>Big in Japan-alright
<BR>Pay! - Then I'll sleep by your side
<BR>Things are easy when you're big in Japan
<BR>Oh when you're big in Japan

<P>Neon on my naked skin, passing silhouettes
<BR>Of strange illuminated mannequins
<BR>Shall I stay here at the zoo
<BR>Or should I go and change my point of view
<BR>For other ugly scenes
<BR>You did what you did to me
<BR>Now it's history I see
<BR>Here's my comeback on the road again
<BR>Things will happen while they can
<BR>I will wait here for my man tonight
<BR>It's easy when you're big in Japan

<P>Aah when you're big in Japan-tonight...
<BR>Big in Japan-be-tight...
<BR>Big in Japan...ooh the eastern sea's so blue
<BR>Big in Japan-alright, pay!
<BR>Then I'll sleep by your side
<BR>Things are easy when you're big in Japan
