<H2>The Road To Hell (Part I)</H2>

<I><B>Chris Rea</B></I>

<P>Stood still on a highway
<BR>I saw a woman
<BR>By the side of the road
<BR>With a face that I knew like my own
<BR>Reflected in my window
<BR>Well she walked up to my quarterlight
<BR>And she bent down real slow
<BR>A fearful pressure paralysed me
<BR>In my shadow
<BR>She said "Son, what are you doing here?
<BR>My fear for you has turned me in my grave"
<BR>I said "Mama, I come to the valley of the rich
<BR>Myself to sell"
<BR>She said "Son, this is the road to Hell"

<P>On your journey 'cross the wilderness
<BR>From the desert to the well
<BR>You have strayed upon the motorway to Hell

<H2>The Road To Hell (Part II)</H2>

Well I'm standing by a river
<BR>But the water doesn't flow
<BR>It boils with every poison you can think of
<BR>And I'm underneath the streetlights
<BR>But the light of joy I know
<BR>Scared beyond belief way down in the shadows
<BR>And the perverted fear of violence
<BR>Chokes a smile on every face
<BR>And common sense is ringing out the bells
<BR>This ain't no technological breakdown
<BR>Oh no, this is the road to Hell

<P>And all the roads jam up with credit
<BR>And there's nothing you can do
<BR>It's all just bits of paper
<BR>Flying away from you
<BR>Look out world take a good look
<BR>What comes down here
<BR>You must learn this lesson fast
<BR>And learn it well
<BR>This ain't no upwardly mobile freeway
<BR>Oh no, this is the road to Hell
