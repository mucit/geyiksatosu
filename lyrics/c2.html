Another head hangs lowly
<BR>Child is slowly
<BR>Taken
<BR>And the violence causes silence
<BR>Who are we mistaking ?
<BR>Mmm, You see,
<BR>It's not me,
<BR>It's not my
<BR>Family,
<BR>In your head
<BR>In your head
<BR>They are fighting

<P>With their tanks
<BR>And their bombs
<BR>And their bombs
<BR>And their guns
<BR>In your head
<BR>In your head
<BR>They are crying

<P>In your head
<BR>In your head
<BR>Zombie
<BR>Zombie
<BR>Zombie

<P>What's in your head
<BR>In your head
<BR>Zombie
<BR>Zombie
<BR>Zombie oh

<P>Another mother's breaking
<BR>Heart is taken-over
<BR>When the violence causes silence
<BR>We must be mistaken

<P>It's the same old teen
<BR>Since 1916
<BR>In your head
<BR>In your head
<BR>They're still fighting

<P>With their tanks
<BR>And their bombs
<BR>And their bombs
<BR>And their guns
<BR>In your head
<BR>In your head
<BR>They are dying

<P>In your head
<BR>In your head
<BR>Zombie
<BR>Zombie
<BR>Zombie

<P>What's in your head
<BR>In your head
<BR>Zombie
<BR>Zombie
<BR>Zombie oh eh-eh-ah-ya-ya
