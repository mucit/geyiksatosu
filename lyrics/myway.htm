<DD>And now the end is near
<DD>And so I face the final curtain
<DD>My friend, I'll say it clear
<DD>I'll state my case of which I'm certain
<DD>I've lived a life that's full
<DD>I travelled each and every highway
<DD>And more, much more than this
<DD>I did it my way

<P><DD>Regrets, I've had a few
<DD>But then again too few to mention
<DD>I did what I had to do
<DD>And saw it through without exception
<DD>I planned each charted course
<DD>Each careful step along the byway
<DD>Oh, and more, much more than this
<DD>I did it my way

<P><DD>Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
<DD>When I bit off more than I could chew
<DD>But through it all, when there was doubt
<DD>I ate it up and spit it out
<DD>I faced it all and I stood tall
<DD>And did it my way

<P><DD>I've loved, I've laughed and cried
<DD>I've had my fails, my share of losing
<DD>And now, as tears subside
<DD>I find it all so amusing
<DD>To think I did all that
<DD>And may I say not in a shy way
<DD>Oh no, oh no not me
<DD>I did it my way

<P><DD>For what is a man, what has he got
<DD>If not himself, then he has not
<DD>To say the words he truly feels
<DD>And not the words he would reveal
<DD>The record shows
<DD>I took the blows
<DD>And did it my way!

<P><DD>Yes, it was my way.
