<BR>Down to Gorky Park
<BR>Listening to the wind of change
<BR>An August summer night
<BR>Soldiers passing by
<BR>Listening to the wind of change

<P>The world is closing in
<BR>Did you ever think
<BR>That we could be so close, like brothers
<BR>The future's in the air
<BR>I can feel it everywhere
<BR>Blowing with the wind of change

<P>Take me to the magic of the moment
<BR>On a glory night
<BR>Where the children of tomorrow dream away
<BR>in the wind of change

<P>Walking down the street
<BR>Distant memories
<BR>Are buried in the past forever
<BR>I folow the Moskva
<BR>Down to Gorky Park
<BR>Listening to the wind of change

<P>Take me to the magic of the moment
<BR>On a glory night
<BR>Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
<BR>With you and me
<BR>Take me to the magic of the moment
<BR>On a glory night
<BR>Where the children of tomorrow dream away
<BR>in the wind of change

<P>The wind of change
<BR>Blows straight into the face of time
<BR>Like a stormwind that will ring the freedom bell
<BR>For peace of mind
<BR>Let your balalaika sing
<BR>What my guitar wants to say

<P>Take me to the magic of the moment
<BR>On a glory night
<BR>Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
<BR>With you and me
<BR>Take me to the magic of the moment
<BR>On a glory night
<BR>Where the children of tomorrow dream away
<BR>in the wind of change
