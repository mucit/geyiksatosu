<H2>Moonlight and Vodka</H2>
<I>by Chris DeBurgh</I>

<BR>Year Released: 1984


<P>Fix me a drink, make it a strong one,

<BR>Hey comrade, a drink, make it a long one,

<BR>My hands are shaking and my feet are numb,

<BR>My head is aching and the bar's going round,

<BR>And I'm so down, in this foreign town;



<P>Tonight there's a band, it ain't such a bad one,

<BR>Play me a song, don't make it a sad one,

<BR>I can't even talk to these Russian girls,

<BR>The beer is lousy and the food is worse,

<BR>And it's so damn cold, yes it's so damn cold,

<BR>I know it's hard to believe,

<BR>But I haven't been warm for a week;



<BR>Moonlight and vodka, takes me away,

<BR>Midnight in Moscow is lunchtime in L.A.,

<BR>Ooh play boys, play...



<P>Espionage is a serious business,

<BR>Well I've had enough of this serious business,

<BR>That dancing girl is making eyes at me,

<BR>I'm sure she's working for the K.G.B.

<BR>In this paradise, ah cold as ice;



<P>Moonlight and vodka, takes me away,

<BR>Midnight in Moscow is sunshine in L.A.,

<BR>Yes, in the good old U.S.A.
