<H2>First We Take Manhattan</H2>

They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
<BR>For trying to change the system from within
<BR>I'm coming now, I'm coming to reward them
<BR>First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

<P>I'm guided by a signal in the heavens
<BR>I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin
<BR>I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons
<BR>First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

<P>I'd really like to live beside you, baby
<BR>I love your body and your spirit and your clothes
<BR>But you see that line there moving through the station?
<BR>I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those

<P>Ah you loved me as a loser, but now you're worried that I just might win
<BR>You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline
<BR>How many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin
<BR>First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

<P>I don't like your fashion business mister
<BR>And I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
<BR>I don't like what happened to my sister
<BR>First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

<P>I'd really like to live beside you, baby ...

<P>And I thank you for those items that you sent me
<BR>The monkey and the plywood violin
<BR>I practiced every night, now I'm ready
<BR>First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

<P>I am guided

<P>Ah remember me, I used to live for music
<BR>Remember me, I brought your groceries in
<BR>Well it's Father's Day and everybody's wounded
<BR>First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
