<P>My Lady d'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still? 
<BR>I'll wake you tomorrow 
<BR>and you will be my fill, yes, you will be my fill. 
  
<P>My Lady d'Arbanville, why does it grieve me so? 
<BR>But your heart seems so silent. 
<BR>Why do you breathe so low, why do you breathe so low.
  
<P>My Lady d'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still? 
<BR>I'll wake you tomorrow 
<BR>and you will be my fill, yes, you will be my fill. 
  
<P>My Lady d'Arbanville, you look so cold tonight. 
<BR>Your lips feel like winter, 
<BR>your skin has turned to white, your skin has turned to white. 
  
<P>My Lady d'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still? 
<BR>I'll wake you tomorrow 
<BR>and you will be my fill, yes, you will be my fill. 
  
<P>La la la la la.... 
  
<P>My Lady d'Arbanville why does it grieve me so? 
<BR>But your heart seems so silent. 
<BR>Why do you breathe so low, why do you breathe so low, 
  
<P>I loved you my lady, though in your grave you lie, 
<BR>I'll always be with you 
<BR>This rose will never die, this rose will never die.
