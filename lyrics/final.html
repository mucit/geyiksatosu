<H2>Final Countdown</H2>

<I><B>Europe</B></I>

<P>We're leaving together
<BR>But still it's farewell
<BR>And maybe we'll come back
<BR>To earth, who can tell?

<P>I guess there is no one to blame
<BR>We're leaving ground
<BR>Will things ever be the same again?

<P>it's the final countdown...

<P>We're heading for Venus and still we stand tall
<BR>Cause maybe they've seen us and welcome us all
<BR>With so many light years to go and things to be found
<BR>I'm sure that we'll all miss her so

<P>It's the final countdown...
<BR>the final countdown...
<BR>It's the final countdown.
