<H2>Tell Him</H2>

I'm scared
<BR>So afraid to show I care
<BR>Will he think me weak
<BR>If I tremble when I speak
<BR>Oooh - what if
<BR>There's another one he's thinking of
<BR>Maybe he's in love
<BR>I'd feel like a fool
<BR>Life can be so cruel
<BR>I don't know what to do

<P>I've been there
<BR>With my heart out in my hand
<BR>But what you must understand
<BR>You can't let the chance
<BR>To love him pass you by

<P>Should I tell him

<P>Tell him that the sun and moon
<BR>Rise in his eyes
<BR>Reach out to him
<BR>And whisper
<BR>Tender words so soft and sweet
<BR>Hold him close to feel his heart beat
<BR>Love will be the gift you give yourself

<P>Touch him
<BR>With the gentleness you feel inside
<BR>Your love can't be denied
<BR>The truth will set you free
<BR>You'll have what's mean to be
<BR>All in time you'll see

<P>I love him
<BR>Of that much I can be sure
<BR>I don't think I could endure
<BR>If I let him walk away
<BR>When I have so much to say

<P>I'll

<P>Love is light that surely glows
<BR>In the hearts of those who know
<BR>It's a steady flame that grows
<BR>Feed the fire with all the passion you can show
<BR>Tonight love will assume its place
<BR>This memory time cannot erase
<BR>Blind faith will lead love where it has to go

<P>Never let him go
