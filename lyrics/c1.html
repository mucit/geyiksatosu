<H2>Salvation</H2>

To all those people doing lines
<BR>Don't do it, don't do it
<BR>Inject your soul with liberty
<BR>It's free, it's free
<BR>To all the kids with heroin eyes
<BR>Don't do it, don't do it
<BR>'Cos it's not not what it seems,
<BR>Oh no it's not not what it seems.

<P>(Chorus)
<BR>Salvation, salvation
<BR>Salvation is free
<BR>Salvation, salvation
<BR>Salvation is free

<P>To all the parents with sleepless nights, sleepless nights
<BR>Tie your kids onto their beds
<BR>Clean their heads
<BR>To all the kids with heroin eyes
<BR>Don't do it, don't do it
<BR>'Cos it's not not what it seems
<BR>Oh no it's not not what it seems

<P>(Chorus)
