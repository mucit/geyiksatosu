<H2>Twist in My Sobriety</H2>
<I><B>Lyrics: Pet Shop Boys</B></I>

<P>All God's children need travelling shoes
<BR>Drive your problems from here
<BR>All good people read good books
<BR>Now your conscience is clear (hi hi hi hi hi)
<BR>Now your conscience is clear

<P>In the morning, when I wipe my brow
<BR>Wipe the miles away
<BR>I like to think that I can be so willed
<BR>And never do what you say (hi hi hi hi hi)
<BR>And never do what you say

<P><DD>Look, my eyes are just holograms 
<DD>Look, your love has drawn red from my hands 
<DD>In my hands you know you'll never be 
<DD>More than twist in my sobriety 

<P>(Twist)
<BR>(Twist)

<P>We just poked a little empty pie
<BR>For the fun that people had at night
<BR>Late at night don't need hostility
<BR>The timid smile, and pause to free
<BR>I don't care about their different thoughts (Aah aah aah)
<BR>Different thoughts are good for me (Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
<BR>Up in arms and chaste and whole
<BR>All God's children took their toll

<P><DD>Look, my eyes are just holograms 
<DD>Look, your love has drawn red from my hands 
<DD>In my hands you know you'll never be 
<DD>More than twist in my sobriety 

<P>(Twist)
<BR>(Twist)

<P>Half the people read the papers
<BR>Read them good and well (Oh yeah)
<BR>Pretty people, nervous people
<BR>People have got to sell (Oh yeah)
<BR>News you have to sell (Oh yeah)

<P><DD>Look, my eyes are just holograms 
<DD>Look, your love has drawn red from my hands 
<DD>In my hands you know you'll never be 
<DD>More than twist in my sobriety 

<P>[repeat]
